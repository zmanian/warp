"""Behavioral and packaging checks for the bundled factory-files skill.

The skill no longer carries a copy of the Factory file format. warp-server owns
the format and decides whether a tree is valid, so there is nothing here that
asserts which documents the format accepts - those cases live beside the parser
in warp-server (logic/factoryfile).

What is left to check is everything the client is still responsible for:

- which files it selects and uploads, and which it refuses to read
- that it reports the server's verdict as the server worded it
- that every way of not reaching a verdict is reported as "not validated"
  rather than as a pass

That last one is the point of the whole design. A stale local copy of the
format used to answer confidently and wrongly; the replacement must never
imply a tree was checked when it was not.

Run directly, or via script/presubmit.
