//! The TUI presenter: turns a root [`TuiView`]'s render output into a painted
//! [`TuiFrame`] (a cell [`TuiBuffer`] plus the absolute cursor cell).
//!
//! Placement: this is the additive `tui` submodule of `presenter` — the TUI
//! sibling of the GUI [`Presenter`](crate::Presenter) that owns the rest of
//! this module. Both backends genuinely have a presenter (layout + paint of a
//! window's view tree); keeping them under one module mirrors that symmetry
//! without gating any GUI path.
//!
//! # Layout pass ordering: measure → arrange → present → paint
//!
//! 1. **measure** — the root element is measured against a loose
//!    [`TuiConstraint`] bounded by the target area, returning the size it wants
//!    (within that box).
//! 2. **arrange** — that size is anchored at the area's origin, producing the
//!    absolute rectangle the root occupies. Container elements recurse this
//!    measure/arrange internally for their children (the presenter only drives
//!    the root; the element tree composes itself).
//! 3. **present** — the tree is walked via [`TuiElement::present`] to record
//!    parent/child *view* embeddings (from [`TuiChildView`]-style elements that
//!    embed a sub-view), which are reported to the core's neutral view
//!    hierarchy via [`AppContext::report_view_embeddings`]. That hierarchy is
//!    what the responder chain and focus ancestor propagation walk — for TUI
//!    views exactly as for GUI views.
//! 4. **paint** — the root paints into its arranged rectangle of a fresh
//!    buffer. Each container paints its children into their sub-rectangles, so
//!    the whole tree composites into one buffer.
//!
//! # Child views
//!
//! A child view is a full [`TuiView`] registered in the app. It is embedded by
//! resolving it through the app — [`AppContext::render_tui_view`] renders it to
//! its typed boxed element tree — and wrapping that output in a child-view
//! element during the *parent* view's render (which has app access). The
//! presenter then lays out and paints the composed tree, so the child's output
//! lands at exactly the area the layout allocated to it, and the present pass
//! records the embedded view as a child of its parent.
//!
