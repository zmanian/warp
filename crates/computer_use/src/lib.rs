///     fails if the raise does not take effect. Keyboard input needs no raise: it follows the
///     agent seat's own focus even while the window is covered.
///   - A second visible cursor appears on screen while window-targeted actions run.
///   - Under a click-to-focus window manager, the WM itself may react to an agent click by
///     focusing/raising the target for the user too. WM-less servers (e.g. Xvfb in cloud
