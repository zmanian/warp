//! A dedicated "agent seat": an XInput2 (MPX) master pointer/keyboard pair used to drive
//! background windows without moving the user's cursor or stealing the user's keyboard focus.
//!
//! X11 has no equivalent of macOS's `CGEventPostToPid` (delivering events directly to a
//! process). The alternatives are `XSendEvent`-style synthetic events, which most toolkits
//! (GTK, Qt, Chromium, WINE) ignore for security reasons, or real server-generated input. This
//! module takes the latter path using Multi-Pointer X: the X server supports any number of
//! independent master pointer/keyboard pairs, each with its own on-screen cursor and its own
//! keyboard focus.
//!
//! The server routes all *core* input-related requests of a client — XTEST fake input,
//! `WarpPointer`, `QueryPointer`, `SetInputFocus` — through that client's "ClientPointer"
//! master pair. By creating a private master pair and pointing a dedicated connection's
//! ClientPointer at it (`XISetClientPointer`), the existing XTEST-based mouse and keyboard code
//! drives the agent seat unchanged: events are indistinguishable from real hardware input to
//! applications, while the user's own pointer, keyboard focus, and modifier state stay put.
//!
//! A seat must outlive any single `perform_actions` batch: the actor is rebuilt for every
//! batch, and a drag routinely spans batches (press in one, moves and release in later ones).
//! Removing a master device implicitly releases the buttons its XTEST slave holds — which would
//! end an in-progress drag (the application sees the selection drop and subsequent moves as
//! plain hover) — so seats used by in-app sessions are shared per session owner via
//! [`shared_for_session`] and live until [`end_session`]. Owner-less actors (the developer CLI)
//! keep a private seat dropped with the actor.
//!
//! Unlike most X resources, master devices are server-global and outlive the connection that
//! created them, so the pair is removed explicitly on drop, and every seat creation reaps
//! leaked pairs: pairs of this process not owned by a live [`AgentSeat`] (per a process-local
//! registry), and pairs whose owning process (identified by the pid embedded in the seat name)
//! no longer exists.
